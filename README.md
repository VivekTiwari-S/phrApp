# Product Health Rater (phrApp)  

## 📌 Overview  
**Product Health Rater (phrApp)** is a Flask-based machine learning application that evaluates consumable products and provides **health-related ratings and insights**. The system uses a trained ML model to classify and score products, helping users make better choices about food and consumer goods.  

The project demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment — from **data preprocessing and model training (Jupyter Notebook)** to **Flask integration and real-time web application**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🧪 **ML-powered Health Rating** – Predicts product healthiness with ~70% accuracy.  
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – Flask + HTML templates for a simple and interactive user experience.  
- 📊 **Data-driven Insights** – Uses structured product data to generate meaningful health scores.  
- ⚡ **Scalable Deployment** – Model serialized with `pickle` (`health_api.pkl` + `scaler.pkl`) for lightweight integration.  
- 📂 **End-to-End Workflow** – From dataset preprocessing → model training → Flask deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

**Programming:** Python  
**Libraries & Frameworks:** Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pickle  
**Frontend:** HTML (Jinja2 templates), CSS  
**Data:** Custom dataset (`krups_phr_data.csv`)  
**Notebooks:** Model training and preprocessing (`phr_model.ipynb`)

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved ~80% accuracy on product health rating task.  
- Successfully deployed ML model into Flask for **real-time predictions**.  
- Demonstrated a **user-friendly web app** where inputs are processed and ratings are generated instantly.  

---

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Enhance model accuracy with larger and more diverse datasets.  
- Add **nutrition-based explanations** for each prediction.  
- Enable **visual dashboards** for health analytics.  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)** for public access.
